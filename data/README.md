### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. 

In this project we directly referenced the csv file from the [Compas github](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/compas-recidivism-risk-score-data-and-analysis) in the Python notebooks, but also have included the csv file in this folder for reference. We specifically use the 2 year recidivism dataÂ to train and test the algorithms.
